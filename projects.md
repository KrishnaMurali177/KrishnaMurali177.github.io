## _Projects_

### [_Deep Learning for Terrain Detection_](https://github.com/KrishnaMurali177/Deep-Learning-Terrain-Identification)
Constructing a deep learning model to identify terrain based on accelerometer and gyro meter inputs on time distributed data. Data cleaned in timesteps and predicting the terrain based on the previous 40 timesteps of inputs through a four layered dense CNN with swish activation and batch normalization.

### [_Supervised Learning Techniques for Sentiment Analytics_](https://github.com/KrishnaMurali177/Algorithms-for-Data-Guided-Business-Intelligence/tree/master/Supervised%20Learning%20Techniques%20for%20Sentiment%20Analysis)
Perform sentiment analysis over IMDB movie reviews and Twitter data to classify tweets or movie reviews as either positive or negative given a labeled training data to build the model and labeled testing data to evaluate the model. Generate embedding/feature vectors using Word2Vec and Doc2Vec techniques and build classifiers using logistic regression as well as a Naive Bayes classifier.

### [_Cotton Tip Image Identification_](https://github.com/KrishnaMurali177/Cotton-Tip-Image-Identification)
Object detection model to identify cotton fiber tips in the microscopic images of cotton fiber. Custom object detection model was built on top of tensorflow model zoo using Single Shot Detector and RetinaNet algorithms to identify the cotton tips.

### [_Bitcoin Price Prediction_](https://github.com/KrishnaMurali177/Algorithms-for-Data-Guided-Business-Intelligence/tree/master/Bitcoin%20Price%20Prediction)
Using Bayesian regression to predict the price of bitcoins based on previous data. Implementing the theory presented in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.1231.pdf), we choose parameters and close in on the regression coeefecients for predicting bitcoin prices.

### [_Deep Neural Network Architectures for defect detection_](https://github.com/KrishnaMurali177/Algorithms-for-Data-Guided-Business-Intelligence/tree/master/DNN%20Architectures%20for%20Defect%20Detection)
Detecting defects on textured surfaces using Image segmentation to detect the pixels where the defect occurs in the given image. Dataset - [here](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/content/weakly-supervised-learning-industrial-optical-inspection). Implementing the approach given in this specific [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597).

### [_DeepWalk: Multipartite Graph Embedding for Recommender Systems_](https://github.com/KrishnaMurali177/Algorithms-for-Data-Guided-Business-Intelligence/tree/master/Graph%20Embedding%20Recommender%20System)
Predict a userâ€™s preference for some item they have not yet rated using a collaborative filtering graph-based technique called DeepWalk. The main steps are:
* Create a heterogeneous information network with nodes consisting of users, item- ratings, items, and other entities related to those items
* Use DeepWalk to generate random walks over this graph
* Based on these random walks, embed the graph in a low dimensional space using word2vec. Evaluate and compare preference propagation algorithms in heterogeneous information networks generated from user-item relationships. Implement and evaluate a word2vec-based method.

### [_Market Segmentation and Influence Propagation_](https://github.com/KrishnaMurali177/Algorithms-for-Data-Guided-Business-Intelligence/tree/master/Market%20Segmentation)
Market segmentation divides a broad target market into subsets of consumers or businesses that have or are perceived to have common needs, interests, and priorities. In this project, we aim to find such market segments given social network data. These social relations can be captured in a graph framework where nodes represent customers/users and edges represent some social relationship. The properties belonging to each customer/user can be treated as node attributes. Hence, market segmentation becomes the problem of community detection over attributed graphs, where the communities are formed based on graph structure as well as attribute similarities. We evaluate the obtained segments via influence propagation (influence an entity in each segment and measure how fast the influence propagates over the entire network).

### [_Twitter Sentiment Analytics with Spark Streaming_](https://github.com/KrishnaMurali177/Algorithms-for-Data-Guided-Business-Intelligence/tree/master/Twitter%20Sentiment%20Analytics)
Perform sentiment analytics on real time tweets using Apache Kafka and Spark.
