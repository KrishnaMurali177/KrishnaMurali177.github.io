## Projects

### [Music Recommender System using Aletrnating Least Squares in Apache Spark](https://github.com/KrishnaMurali177/Algorithms-for-Data-Guided-Business-Intelligence/tree/master/Music%20Recommender%20System)
Performing EDA on RDDs in Spark and Implementing the ALS algorithm in Apache Spark to recommend the top artists a user would listen to according to their previous songs listened data.

### [Bitcoin Price Prediction](https://github.com/KrishnaMurali177/Algorithms-for-Data-Guided-Business-Intelligence/tree/master/Bitcoin%20Price%20Prediction)
Using Bayesian regression to predict the price of bitcoins based on previous data. Implementing the theory presented in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.1231.pdf), we choose parameters and close in on the regression coeefecients for predicting bitcoin prices.

### [Deep Neural Network Architectures for defect detection](https://github.com/KrishnaMurali177/Algorithms-for-Data-Guided-Business-Intelligence/tree/master/DNN%20Architectures%20for%20Defect%20Detection)
Detecting defects on textured surfaces using Image segmentation to detect the pixels where the defect occurs in the given image. Dataset - https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/content/weakly-supervised-learning-industrial-optical-inspection Implementing the approach given in this specific [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597).
